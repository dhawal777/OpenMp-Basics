Q1 Which of the three codes runs faster? Report the times of each of them.


	Static runs faster among all three:-
	Time Static: 0.10368
	Time Guided: 0.109929
	Time dynamic: 3.6993


Q2 What is the run time if the chunk size in dynamic scheduling is set to 100 by replacing
schedule(dynamic) by schedule(dynamic, chunk) in the first code?

	Time dynamic Chunk: 0.115409


Q3 (Loop Case) Compare the above code with schedule(static) and schedule(dynamic). Which of
these three is fastest? Why?

	Time Guided Loop: 36.0009
	Time Static Loop: 54.0007
	Time dynamic Loop: 36.0011

	For loops where each iteration can take very different amounts of time, dynamic schedules,Guided Schedule
	work best as the work will be split more evenly across threads.
